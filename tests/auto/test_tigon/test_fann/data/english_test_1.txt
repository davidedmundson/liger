Despite being born and raised in London's Jewish community to a family of committed Zionists, Barnaby Raine will not be celebrating the centenary of the Balfour Declaration. The PhD student at New York's Columbia University is a practicing Jew, whose mother was part of socialist Zionist movements in her youth and later spent time on a kibbutz. However, that commitment to the Zionist cause was not shared by her son, who is now an ardent critic of Israel and the role Britain played in its creation. Balfour 100 years on: salvation or betrayal? â€“ UpFront "I am now a firm anti-Zionist," Raine told Al Jazeera, explaining that his ideas developed as a teenager when he could not reconcile his Jewish beliefs with Zionist ones. "We as Jews are religiously committed to 'tikkun olam', 'mending the world', and for centuries Jews have stood at the forefront of struggles against oppression and exploitation," he said. "In one corner of the planet in Palestine, we are asked to believe that Jewish values mean not fixing the world but smashing it, not fighting oppression but instilling it with gruesome violence. "That betrayal of Judaism is hard to stomach." A student of history, Raine is critical of the British role in empowering the early Zionist movement, which he considers a result of colonial self-interest rather than genuine concern for the aspirations of the Jewish people. He argued that imperial powers, such as Britain, had a longstanding policy of using settlers from Europe in colonial territories to help administer their empires. "The British did a similar thing in South Africa. Settler-colonists, whether Jewish or Boer, became empire's policemen," Raine explained. British support for the Zionists was therefore not due to the legitimacy of their claim to Palestine, he continued. "Palestine is not the unfortunate meeting of two legitimate national movements...the problem is and always was a single colonial nationalism, which can permit no equal place in the land for its indigenous inhabitants. "The Declaration reserves full 'political' rights for Jews alone, licensed by the British empire to serve as civilised administrators over the natives." The argument is backed by historical evidence. Some early Zionists actively encouraged the presence of Jewish settlers in Palestine serving as a vanguard of British interests in the Middle East. In a letter dated to 1914, the leader of the Zionist movement, Chaim Weizmann wrote: "Should Palestine fall within the British sphere of influence, and should Britain encourage a Jewish settlement there, as a British dependency, we could have in 20 to 30 years a million Jews out there...they would... form a very effective guard for the Suez Canal." In the build up to the centenary of the declaration, Britain has faced calls from pro-Palestinian activists to apologise for its historic role in the dispossession of Palestinians, a demand it rejects outright. According to Raine, besides the futility of such an apology there is little chance of the structures responsible to end the continuation of Palestinian suffering. "Balfour has been reproduced every day for 70 years. Apologising for Balfour would require dismantling that status quo, and few in power in the West would find that an appealing proposition."
